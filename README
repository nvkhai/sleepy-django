Sleepy Django
=============

Thanks for using Sleepy Django!

Installation
------------

From a command prompt/shell type:

	python setup.py install

Make sure you have the sufficient priviledges (su or sudo on a linux system).


What is Sleepy?
---------------

Sleepy, allows you to create a static site by rendering Django templates to HTML.


Why?
---

This allows for, easy prototyping and easier creation of static websites, where
the whole workhorse of Django is not needed.

You are allowed to use all of Django's builtin tags and filters.

If you want more, you can always move to the actual Django, since the templates
are totally compatible.


How?
----

You can create a new project by typing:

	sleepy.py --startproject=myfunsite

Add your templates in there, when you're ready you can compile them by doing:

	sleepy.py --make

And voila!
